## Project Title: SQL-Analysis-of-Netflix-Movies-and-Dataset

**Description**

The product management team assigned us the task of conducting a competitive analysis and preparing a dataset for future use. They specifically wanted insights into the ratio of movies to TV series and the frequency of new titles added by month. Fortunately, our data engineering team prepared a dataset containing information about titles on Netflix. However, there was some additional preparation needed to make this dataset more convenient for addressing these questions and ensuring its usability for future analyses.

To ensure the dataset is robust and ready for analysis, I performed the following key steps:

1. **Imputing Missing Values**: I addressed missing values in the dataset, ensuring a more complete and reliable dataset for analysis.

2. **Extracting Month for Dates**: To facilitate the analysis of the frequency of new titles added by month, I extracted the month information from the dates in the dataset.

3. **In-Depth Data Cleaning**: I executed a thorough data cleaning process, refining the dataset to enhance its overall quality and usability.

4. **Concatenating**: I applied concatenation techniques as necessary, ensuring that the dataset is structured in a way that supports the desired analysis, such as determining the correct rating for movies/tv shows.
