## Project Title: SQL-Analysis-of-Netflix-Movies-and-Dataset

**Description**

The product management team assigned us the task of conducting a competitive analysis and preparing a dataset for future use. They specifically wanted insights into the ratio of movies to TV series and the frequency of new titles added by month. Fortunately, our data engineering team prepared a dataset containing information about titles on Netflix. However, there was some additional preparation needed to make this dataset more convenient for addressing these questions and ensuring its usability for future analyses.
